# Ultra Models Directory

This directory is reserved for ultra-optimized bounce detection models.

## Planned Models

- Lightweight models for real-time performance
- Optimized variants for edge deployment
- Fast inference models
- Compressed model versions

## Status

**ðŸ“‹ Pending Training** - Models will be added as optimization work progresses.

## Related Training Scripts

See `src/training/bounce/` for training scripts:
- `ultra_advanced_trainer.py` - Ultra model training

## Related Detectors

- `src/detection/bounce/simple_ultra_detector.py` - Simple ultra detector
- `src/detection/bounce/optimized_ultra_detector.py` - Optimized ultra detector

## Usage

Once trained, ultra models will be saved here for use with ultra detector implementations.
